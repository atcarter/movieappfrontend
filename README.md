# Movie-App-JavaScript-Project

This repository is the backend to a movie review web application that allows users to post their own movie reviews. [Here is the link to the backend](https://github.com/atcarter/movieappbackend).

## Installation

This web app will be locally hosted on your machine. First, clone this repository as well as the repository on the back end. Then, run `bundle install` to ensure all gems are present. Once this is complete, run `rails s`, and open the `index.html` file from this repository. Once that file's open, you're able to start adding movies and reviews!

## Contributor's Guide

Feel free to help expand the functionality of this application. Eventually, I would like to add the API that I used for my movie_cli app to have a movie's actual information associated with each movie object.
